# bamazon

Utilizing a combination of MySQL and node, this app will take in orders from customers and deplete its stock from the Bamazon store's inventory.

Bamazon store managers will also be able to track their inventory, add to it, and create new listings in the Bamazon store.

To run this app, you'll need to utilize SQL database, node, and the MySQL and Inquirer packages of node.

Take a look at the customer experience!

First, your customer will be given an option of stock to buy, along with the amount. Their total will be displayed and a confirmation message will be sent:

In the case that a customer request is unfillable, they will be given a message demonstrating that the stock is unavailable.

After stock is below '0' customers will still be able to view the stock listing, however, an additional message will be displayed to the right indicating '*Currently out of stock. Sorry for the inconvenience.'
